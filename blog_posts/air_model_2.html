                                <p>If you saw my <a href = "https://joshuaneronha.com/blog_posts/air_model.html">previous post</a>, you may have noticed that
                                I chose to use a regression to build the model for a flight prediction model. But regressions, of course, are inherently limited by
                                predicting future events by fitting past events to some sort of standard function. Artificial neural networks are very interesting because it has
                                been shown that (at least theoretically) they can fit any continuous function, so I wanted to give this method a try in my model!
                                </p>
                                <p>I've updated the visualization from my last post to include two methods of prediction for any route: the same regression-based model
                                    from the last post in addition to a neural network based prediction. I'll briefly discuss my methodology and compare the two methods
                                    but check out the visualization below and new model first -- it works just like the previous map, but this time will show the two predictions side-by-side.
                                </p>
                                <div id="map" style="overflow-x:scroll"></div>
                                <p>
                                    Before comparing the results, I'll quickly discuss my methodology (feel free to take a look at the <a href = "https://github.com/joshuaneronha/nonstop-flight-model/blob/main/Model.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> here).
                                    I used the same variables as the regression, and similarly limited the model to routes with less than 35,000 passengers in the quarter. I scaled the data using a standard
                                    max-min algorithm and split the data into a training and testing set. To actually build the artificial neural network, I used TensorFlow and Keras in Python. I tried a variety of different models
                                    with different sizes, activation functions, and optimizers before landing on the model shown below based on optimal and reproducible results. As you can see in the table below, it 
                                    has four hidden, dense layers, each with 16 or 64 neurons.

                                    The neural network converged at a result within about 75 epochs and had a testing mean square error (MSE) of 4454136. I then used the same
                                    data to re-run the regression, which had a testing MSE of 4807240, indicating an approximately 10% improvement using the neural network model.
                                    Of course, a lower MSE doesn't necesarily mean better results -- it's all about whether they make sense in context, so we'll compare results for
                                    ten randomly chosen routes and see how each model does as a small sample. As a note, the neural network will never give an answer lower than 35
                                    because that seemed to be a global minimum for this neural network (I'm still thinking about why), which is noted in the model.

                                    To look at results in context, I chose two airports using a random number generator ten times and then considered the results, shown below.

                                  <p>There are two broad conclusions we can draw from this comparison:</p>
                                  <ol>
                                      <li>The two models return relatively similar results for routes that are likely to be fairly well-trafficked.</li>
                                      <li>For lower demand routes, the neural network consistently expects signifigantly more passengers than the regression.
                                          This likely results from how the two different models operate. The neural network seems to assume that should a route be launched,
                                          we will see increased demand simply because the route exists despite having small airports on the route, compared to the regression
                                          model, which would simply predict near-zero passengers per day based on the fact that the airports have very small traffic.
                                      </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>As a result, the neural network may be more useful in situations (particularly for smaller routes) where we
                                        expect signifigant demand to be created because of the route's existence, for example drawing passengers away from
                                        other airports (a new route from Providence may steal passengers away from Boston or Hartford, for example). Additionally,
                                        the neural network model has a lower overall MSE, which indicates a slightly better model as well. Both models, of course, are
                                        useful in considering potential new routes and have different strengths and weaknesses, and I look forward to further exploring
                                        the benefits of each.
                                    </p>
